# Parsing Java Source Code for {}, [], ()

The program must be able to analyze if the file has:
1. A proper pairing of {}, [], ().
2. That the scopes are opened and closed in a LIFO fashion.

The program should: 
- Display improper nesting to the console.
- Prompt for a file.
- Show the processing of a file that is correct and a file that has improper scoping.
