# Parsing Java Source Code for {}, [], ()

The program must be able to analyze if the file has:
1. A proper pairing of {}, [], ().
2. That the scopes are opened and closed in a LIFO (Last in First out) fashion.
3. Your program should display improper nesting to the console.
4. Your program should prompt for a file â€“ do NOT hard code the file to be processed.
5. Show the processing of a file that is correct and a file that has improper scoping. */
